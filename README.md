Notes
======
The `index.html` doesn't require any installing it's based on autogenerated min files included in this repository.

The `index.dev.html` requires to follow the installation [informations](#informations).

Installation
============
To make index.dev.html works, run :

    bower install

To run tests, or grunt:

    npm install

Run the tests :

    rm app/app.min.*
    npm test
As I decided to versionned the min files (for easier deployment) we should remove them before running the tests

Run e2e tests :

    npm start
    npm run protractor

Autogenerated files
===================

To regenerate min files (`app.min.js`, `and app.min.css`), run :

    grunt

Remarks
=======

Tests
-----
There quite is few tests, but it's not the aim of this exercice.
So just few unit tests and e2e tests

Factories
--------
The factories are supposed to call REST services so I just made raw json manipulation that could be re-made
